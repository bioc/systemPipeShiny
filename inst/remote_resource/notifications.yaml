        ## SPS notifications
        What you are looking at is the SPS notification broadcasting system. It
        display messages to your users by reading a remote `yaml` file stored
        online. SPS will fetch the content of this file and translate it to different
        notes you can see here. So you do not need to re-deploy the app every time
        there is a new notification.
        1. You can customize your own notifications by
           using [this file as template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/systemPipeR/systemPipeShiny/master/inst/remote_resource/notifications.yaml).
        2. After the modification, place this file in public accessible location, like
           Github, do not inlcude this file in app deployment.
        3. During app deployment, indicate the URL of this file in `global.R`
           file, `note_url:` option.
