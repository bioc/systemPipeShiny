## About Me
***
+ I am Plant Biologist, fascinated with plant physiology, molecular biology, and computational science.

+ I earned my Ph.D. in Genetics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (2016). The main goal was to integrate plant biology and bioinformatics focusing on the study the differentially expressed genes under drought condition and on identifying mechanisms of response to this stress in castor beans.

+ After a year and a half working in a private company in Brazil, I joined Professor Thomas Girke Lab at UCR in 2017. My current research focuses on the development of computational data analysis methods for genome biology. My main interests are the development of integrated systems for NGS data analysis for R and Bioconductor open source software projects. The following gives a short summary of my career and the current projects.
