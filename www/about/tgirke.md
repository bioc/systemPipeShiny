## Summary
> My research focuses on the development of computational data analysis methods for genome biology and small molecule discovery. This includes discovery-oriented data mining projects, as well as algorithm and software development projects for data types from a variety of high-throughput technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS), genome-wide profiling approaches and chemical genomics. As part of the multidisciplinary nature of my field, I frequently collaborate with experimental scientists on data analysis projects of complex biological networks. Another important activity is the development of integrated data analysis systems for the open source software projects R and Bioconductor.
