# Introduction

**<span style="color:#5DA7D6;">s</span>ystem<span
style="color:#5DA7D6;">P</span>ipe<span style="color:#5DA7D6;">S</span>hiny**
(SPS) extends the widely used [systemPipeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/systemPipeR/) 
(SPR) workflow
environment with a versatile graphical user interface provided by a [Shiny
App](https://shiny.rstudio.com). This allows non-R users, such as
experimentalists, to run many systemPipeR's workflow designs, control, and
visualization functionalities interactively without requiring knowledge of R.
Most importantly, `SPS` has been designed as a general purpose framework for
interacting with other R packages in an intuitive manner. Like most Shiny Apps,
SPS can be used on both local computers as well as centralized server-based
deployments that can be accessed remotely as a public web service for using
SPR's functionalities with community and/or private data. The framework can
integrate many core packages from the R/Bioconductor ecosystem. Examples of
SPS' current functionalities include: (a) interactive creation of experimental
designs and metadata using an easy to use tabular editor or file uploader; (b)
visualization of workflow topologies combined with auto-generation of R
Markdown preview for interactively designed workflows; (c) access to a wide
range of data processing routines; (d) and an extendable set of visualization
functionalities. Complex visual results can be managed on a 'Canvas Workbench'
allowing users to organize and to compare plots in an efficient manner combined
with a session snapshot feature to continue work at a later time. The present
suite of pre-configured visualization examples include different methods to
plot a count table. The modular design of 
SPR makes it easy to design custom functions without any knowledge of Shiny, 
as well as extending the environment in the future with contributions from 
the community.

An example web instance for testing `SPS` online is available
[here](https://tgirke.shinyapps.io/systemPipeShiny/){target="_blank"}. At the
time of writing, there are five interactive tutorials embedded in this instance
that users can access from the upper-right corner. Each tutorial introduces 
major functionalities of SPS.

# Installation

The `systemPipeShiny` package can be installed from a user's R console as follows.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("systemPipeShiny")
```

If the user's OS is Linux then one may need to install the following dependencies.
The following example applies to Ubuntu.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt-get install libv8-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

*libcurl4-openssl-dev* may not be required for Ubuntu > 18.04.

On other Linux distributions, the install commands may be slightly different. 

# Main functionalities 

Currently, `SPS` includes two main functional categories: 
 1. Some pre-defined modules include: 
    a. A workbench for designing and configuring data analysis workflows, 
    b. Downstream analysis and visualization tools for RNA-Seq, and 
    c. A space to make quick ggplots. 
 2. A data
visualization (VS) toolbox (*Fig 1*). The WF module allows to write and to
modify configuration files required for running workflows in `systemPipeR`. The
VS module provides a rich set of plotting tools to visualize the results of
individual steps in `systemPipeR` workflow. The latter includes a Canvas
functionality that allows to arrange many plots in one page, save their them
and revisit the saved plots at a later time.

</center>
**Figure 1.** Design of `systemPipeShiny.` 

The framework provides an
interactive web interface for workflow management and data visualization.

Within the functional categories, `SPS` functions are modularized in
sub-components, here referred to as **SPS tabs** that are similar to 
menu tabs in other GUI applications that organize related and inter-connected 
functionalies into groups. On the backend, **SPS tabs** are based on [Shiny modules](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html), 
that are stored in separate files. This modular structure is highly extensible 
and greatly simplifies the design of new `SPS` tabs by both users and/or developers. 
Details about extending existing tabs and designing new ones are provided in 
an [advanced user section](#extend-sps). 

# Example workflow with toy RNA-Seq data

The following sections illustrate the main functionalities of `SPS` using an analysis 
workflow for RNA-Seq data as an example.

## Load package

Load the `systemPipeShiny` package in your R session.

```{r sps_load_package, eval=TRUE}
library(systemPipeShiny)
```

## Initialize `SPS` project

Before launching the `SPS` application, a project environment needs to be created with the
following command.

```{r spsinit, eval=FALSE}
spsInit()
```

For this toy example, the project directory structure is written to a temporary
directory on a user's system. For a real project, it should be written to a
defined and user controlled location on a system rather than a temporary
directory.

```{r spsinit_temp, eval=TRUE}
sps_tmp_dir <- tempdir()
spsInit(app_path = sps_tmp_dir, change_wd = FALSE, project_name = "SPSProject")
sps_dir <- file.path(sps_tmp_dir, "SPSProject")
```

### SPS project structure

The file and directory structure of an SPS project is organized as follows. 

<pre>

</pre>

## Launch `SPS` 

By default, the working directory will be set inside the project folder automatically. 
To launch the `SPS` Shiny application, one only needs to execute the following command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
shiny::runApp()
```

After the SPS app has been launched, clicking the "Continue to app" button
on the welcome screen will open the main dashboard (Fig.2).


<center id="sps_ui">
![sps_ui](./img/sps_ui_main.jpg)
</center>
**Figure 2:** Snapshot of SPS' UI.

1. Welcome screen.
2. Module tabs.
3. User defined custom tabs.
4. The Canvas tab.
5. All SPS tabs has this description on top. It is highly recommend to click here 
   to expand and read the full the description for the first time.

Alternatively, when using RStudio one can click the <img src=img/app_start.png style="display: inline;
padding-left:0; width:10px; height:15px;">`Run App` button in the top right corner.

In addition, in Rstudio the *global.R* file will be automatically
opened when the `SPS` project is created. Custom changes can be made inside this file
before the app launches. The [advanced section](#extend-sps) explains how
to change and create new custom tabs. 

## Workflow management

The workflow management module in `SPS` allows to modify or create the
configuration files required for running data analysis workflows in
[systemPipeR](https://systempipe.org/docs/systemPipeR/) (SPR). This includes
three types of important files: a sample metadata (targets) file, a
workflow file (in R Markdown format) defining the workflow steps, and workflow running 
files in Common [Workflow Language (CWL)](https://www.commonwl.org/) format. In SPS, one can easily create
these files under the "Workflow Management" module, located in navigation bar
on the left of the dashboard (Fig2 - 2). 

The current version of `SPS` allows to:

1. create a workflow environment;
2. create and/or check the format of targets / workflow / CWL files;
3. download the prepared workflow files to run elsewhere, like a cluster;
4. directly excecute the workflow from SPS.


### 1. setup a workflow 
<center>
![wf_setup](./img/sps_wf_setup.jpg)
</center>
**Figure 3. A.** Workflow Management - Targets File

1. On the workflow module, read the instructions and choose step 1, it should be 
automatically opened for you.
2. Choose a folder where you want to create the workflow environment.
3. Choose a workflow template. These are SPR workflows and mainly are next-generation 
sequencing workflows. 
4. Click "Gen workflow" to create the workflow project. 
5. You should see a pop-up saying about the project path and other information. 
Clicking the pop-up will jump you to the step 2. The status tracker and banner for 
step 1 should all turn green. 


### 2. Prepare a target file

The targets file defines all input file paths and other sample information of
analysis workflows. To better undertand the structure of this file, one can
consult the ["Structure of targets
file"](https://systempipe.org/docs/systemPipeR/#structure-of-targets-file)
section in the SPR vignette. Essentially, this is the tabular file representation
of the `colData` slot in an `SummarizedExperiment` object which stores sample
IDs and other meta information. 

The following step-by-step instructions explain how to create and/or modify targets 
files using RNA-Seq as an example (Fig.3 A):

1. Your project targets file is loaded for you, but you can choose to upload a different one.
2. You can edit, right click to add/remove rows/columns (The first row is treated as column names).
3. SPR target file includes a header block, that can also be edited in the SPS app. Each headers needs to start with a "#". Header is only useful for RNA-Seq workflow in current SPR. You can define sample comparison groups 
here. Leave it as default for other projects. 
4. The section on the left provides sample statistics and information whether files exist inside the workflow project's `data` directory. Choose any column you want from the dropdown to check and watch the statistics bar change in this section.
5. statistic status bar. 
6. Clicking on "Add to task" can help you to check if your target file has any formatting problem. You should see a green success pop-up if everything is right. Now your target file is ready and you can click "save" to download it and later use in a SPR project. 

<center>
![wf_targets](./img/sps_ui_target.jpg)
</center>
**Figure 3. A.** Workflow Management - Targets File

### 3. Prepare a workflow file

In SPR, workflows are defined in Rmarkdown files, you can read details and obtain them  [here](https://systempipe.org/pages/pipelines_area/).

Now let us follow the order below to see how SPS helps you to prepare a workflow file for a RNAseq project (Fig.3 B):

1. Your project workflow file is loaded for you, but you can choose to upload a different one.
2. The workflow structure is displayed in a tree-leaf-like plot. 
3. Check all steps in the workflow that you want to include. You can skip (uncheck) some steps but it may cause the workflow to fail. Read more SPR instructions before do so. 
4. Clicking on the "Plot steps" will show a flow chart of what the step execution orders will be when you run the workflow in SPR. 
5. Clicking "Report preview" generates a preview of what the final report will look like for current RNAseq workflow (hidden in Fig 3.B), but in the preview, no code is evaluated.
6. If you are satisfied with your workflow file, click "Add to task" to save your workflow file.

<center>
![wf_wf](./img/sps_ui_wf.jpg)
</center>
**Figure 3. B.** Workflow Management - Workflow File

### 4. Prepare CWL files (optional)

In the new version of SPR, all individual system workflow steps are called by the 
CWL files. Each SPR workflow has a set of CWL files and normally users do not need 
to make any change. In case you want to learn more about CWL and create some new 
CWL files, Step 4 is a good place to practice. 

To run a CWL step in SPR, 3 files are required: 

- targets: to determine how many samples will be run and sample names.
- CWL running file: can be translated to bash code;
- CWL input: variables to inject into the running file 

SPR is the parser between R and CWL by injecting sample information from targets 
to `CWL input` file and then CWL parser translate it to bash code. 

1. Most poeple are not familar this part, read instruction carefully.
2. Your project targets has been loaded for you, and an example CWL running and input 
for **hisat2** is also loaded for you. Directly parse the code. See what commandline 
code you get. 
3. Change the targets injecting column, and parse again, see what has changed. 
4. You can edit the CWL running and input files
5. Try to parse the new file and see what has changed.
6. If new CWL files has been created, you can edit workflow Rmd files by adding your 
new system steps. 

<center>

</center>
**Figure 3. C.** Workflow Management - CWL File

###  5. Run or finish workflow preparation



Up until this step, congratulations, the workflow is prepared. You can choose to 
download the workflow project files as a bundle or continue to run the workflow. 

<center>
![wf_cwl](./img/sps_wf_run.jpg)
</center>
**Figure 4.A.B** Workflow Runner

1. On step 5 you can choose to download the prepared workflow or directly run the 
workflow. However, if you do not have the required commandline tools, workflow will 
most likely fail.
2. Open up the runner. It is a Rstudio like interface. 
3. Code editor. Required workflow running code is pre-entered for you. You can simply 
hit "Run" to start. Of course, you can delete the default code and run random R 
code. 
4. Ouput R console. 
5. Workflow running log.
6. View any plot output. and send a copy of your current plot to SPS Canvas tab or 
download it. 

## Snap shots and Canvas

### Canvas

SPS Canvas is a place to display and manage snapshots.  Snapshots can come from different
plot tabs, or the same plot tab with different plot options. Here you can combine 
plots together to a big scientific figure or compare plots with different plotting options side by side. 

If you have followed the instructions so far, you should have at least two snapshots and we can start to use Canvas.

1. Select "Canvas" tab.
2. If you have some snapshots, you will see your snapshots in "Current snapshots" box, otherwise it will only be a message telling you to create some snapshots. If you do not want to see any of them, drag it to the right side so it will not be rendered on Canvas. Clicking on "*DESTROY*" will permanently delete selected snapshots and **cannot be recovered**.
3. Click "Refresh Canvas" to render the Canvas for a quick glimpse.
4. You can change some Canvas settings on here. Clicking on "Refresh Canvas" again will apply these changes.
5. Move your mouse on the plots, you can see they are still interactive. Then, when you move the mouse near the top of a plot, a title section will show up and you can drag it to reposition your plot. 
6. Similar to a plot tab, you can resize any plot on Canvas by dragging the bottom right corner of a plot. 
7.  Download your current snapshots to a compressed file, and you can upload saved snapshot file and continue to work on it later. Note: uploading snapshots will overwrite current snapshots.

Due to internet security reasons, snapshot files are encrypted. Each SPS project 
has an unique key pair. Therefore, it is not possible to run a snapshot file in 
a different SPS project. 

Taking too many snapshots will slow down the app. A good solution is to delete/clean 
unwanted snapshots often. 

<center>
![plot_tab](./img/sps_ui_canvas.png)
</center>
**Figure 6 A.** Canvas

Now go back to [Load raw count data](#load-raw-count-data) section and select 
"PCA" option in step 6 to reprocess and then go to PCA plot tab and repeat
instructions in [Create a plot](#create-a-plot) to create and snapshot a few PCA 
plots. The PCA plot tab has an additional plot point size control UI. You can try 
to take snapshots with different point size. Finally come back to canvas and render all snapshots. You should then be able to see how point size on plots are different in different snapshots. 
Now you can have a better understanding of the SPS snapshot-Cnavas feature.

# Advanced features

## Configuration

### App options

App options in SPS are controlled by "SPS options". These options can change 
app appearance, debugging level, server server behaviors, *etc*. The valid options can 
be found and change on the `global.R` file. They are similar to *Shiny* options, 
but unlike *shiny* options are single values, SPS options are passed using the `Option(sps = list(...))` 
function in `global.R` as a group. To view all options and their default, valid
values('*' means any value is okay):

```{r, eval=TRUE}
viewSpsDefaults(app_path = sps_dir)
```

To view a single option value, use `spsOption(opt = "OPTION_NAME")`; to overwrite a single 
option, use `spsOption(opt = "OPTION_NAME", value = "NEW_VALUE")`.

<p style="color:var(--info)">Note: Do not worry if you set some invalid values, on app start, `sps()` will check all SPS
options, ignore unknown values and set invalid values back to default. You will see warning 
messages on console to tell you specifically what is wrong with your options.</p>

| Option          | Description                       | Default | Other     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| mode            | running mode                      | "local" | "server"  |
| warning_toast   | show security warnings?           | TRUE    | FALSE     |
| loading_screen  | show loading screen?              | TRUE    | FALSE     |
| loading_theme   | loading screen theme              | "vhelix"| any string|
| use_crayon      | colorful console message?         | TRUE    | FALSE     |
| verbose         | more details for SPS functions?   | FALSE   | TRUE      |
| admin_page      | show admin page?                  | FALSE   | TRUE      |
| admin_url       | admin_page query url              | "admin" | any string|

some details:

- mode: this option will change how the upload files are selected.
    - local: You can choose file from server side, and it is a direct link, no file will be copied to server. Most often used when you are on you own computer. <span style="color:var(--info)">It is still choosing files from the server side, because you are using your own computer as a Shiny server.</span>
    - server: Choose files from the client side, and upload as a temp file to the server.
    - If you are on you own computer, there is no difference, but `local` mode can avoid copy your files to temp. <span style="color:var(--info)">If you are deploying the app to cloud, please **use server mode**</span>
- warning_toast: A toast pop-up message when you are under some dangerous options when app starts.
- loading_theme: `loading_screen` must be `TRUE`. Only one theme for now, we will add more in future.
- verbose: Give you more information on debugging.
- admin_url: the admin page url, `admin_page` must be `TRUE` for it to work. It will be added in an upcoming version, a preview can be seen by adding "/?admin" to the end of app url, e.g. "[https://tgirke.shinyapps.io/systemPipeShiny/?admin](https://tgirke.shinyapps.io/systemPipeShiny/?admin)".

### Tab configurations

Tabs are registered(defined) by the *tabs.csv* file under SPS project *config* folder. It contains information for all 
the tabs. Do not modify it if you don't plan to build new tabs. See [developer section](#extend-spsfor-developers) for how 
to operate this file. 

To control what tabs to appear(load/unload) on SPS, pass the tab IDs of tabs you want to see to 
`tabs =` argument on `sps()`

```{r , eval=FALSE}
sps_app <- sps(tabs = c("ID1", "ID2", ...))
```

*tabs.csv* has all the tab IDs. Under current version of SPS, you can only load/unload 
tabs in the "vs" type. Tabs under "core" and "wf" types are unable to change.

## A variety of additional shiny widgets 

There are many useful HTML components that 
can be use outside out SPS. You can include these widgets in your own Shiny apps without 
loading SPS main framework. 

# Extend `SPS`

As a framework, `SPS` allows users to add/remove/customize individual tabs. At current 
version, you can only modify tabs in Visualization module (data tabs, plot tabs). 
Use `spsNewTab` to create new tabs. This function
will help you to **create the tab file**, store it to the *R* folder in your SPS project, and
**register tab information** by adding records to *config/tabs.csv*.
Most arguments are self-explanatory or can be 
easily understood by reading the the help file. 

## Adding the new tabs at your SPS application 

In your *global.R*, scroll down to the bottom, you should see:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sps_app <- sps(
    tabs = c("data_example", "plot_example1", "plot_example2"),
    server_expr = {
        msg("Custom expression runs -- Hello World", "GREETING", "green")
    }
)
```

This is the SPS main function. You can load/unload tabs by providing tab IDs in `vstabs` argument, like
`c("tab1", "tab2)`. Open *config/tabs.csv* or use `spsTabInfo()` to see what tabs IDs can be load and other
tab information. Currently you can only load/unload visualization tabs, the key word `vs` under column "*type*";
essential framework tabs(*core*) and workflow tabs (*wf*) are loaded automatically and these tabs cannot be modified.

# How to deploy the application

Among several options of deployment of your `SPS` custom application, here you can find the example of [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). 
To get started, it is required to create a *shinyapps.io* account. Please follow this [tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html) 
with all the instructions to create an account. 
`SPS` project provides a ready-to-use file, `deploy.R`, with the required information to configure ShinyApps account and deploy the application.

Once the account is set correctly, you can deploy it as soon as the project is created. It 
is recommended to create -> test/run -> deploy a Shiny app from Rstudio and follow 
[this tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html).
