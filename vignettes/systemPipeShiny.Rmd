# Introduction

**<span style="color:#5DA7D6;">s</span>ystem<span style="color:#5DA7D6;">P</span>ipe<span style="color:#5DA7D6;">S</span>hiny**(SPS)
is a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)-based R/Bioconductor package that has 
a graphical user interface (GUI). SPS is able to:

 1. Help for researchers on data analysis workflow management and downstream data 
visualizations in quick and user friendly manner. 
 2. Provides an framework to be fast extended with more components and 
 an web app that is open-box-ready-to-deploy to any Shiny server.
 
You can try our demo at [here](https://tgirke.shinyapps.io/systemPipeShiny/). There are 5 
different interactive tutorials embedded on the demo that you can follow(right upper corner). 
Each tutorial covers a major topic of SPS and shows how you can interactive with app.

This vignette illustrate the main concepts of SPS by using an RNAseq workflow as the 
example.


# Installation

To install SPS:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("systemPipeShiny")
```

If you are on Linux, you also need(use Ubuntu as example):

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt-get install libv8-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```
*libcurl4-openssl-dev* may not be required for Ubuntu > 18.04.

Depending on the Linux distributions, the command can be slightly different. 

# Main concept 

The SPS is designed into two major categories, workflow management (WF) and 
data visualization (VS) (*Fig 1*). WF part helps users to 
prepare data analysis workflow files. 
VS part helps users to make different types of plots, take interactive snapshot 
of plots and combine/compare different plots on the "Canvas" workbench. 

<center id="sps_structure">
![SPS_structure](./img/sps_structure.png)
**Figure 1. SPS Structure**
</center>

Inside the two major categories, there are small components. They are **SPS tabs**. 
A SPS tab is similar to any other web dashboard tabs you see on the internet. Tabs 
in SPS are built on top of [Shiny modules](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html) 
as individual files. The modular structure makes it very easy to extend with more 
SPS tabs. Functions and instructions are provided in the [developer section](#extend-sps). 


# Step-by-step instruction of with an example workflow

Let us use an **RNAseq** workflow as the example to demonstrate how to use SPS.

## Create a SPS project

After installation and before launching SPS, the first thing you need to do is to create 
a SPS project: 

```{r spsinit, eval=TRUE}
sps_tmp_dir <- tempdir()
spsInit(app_path = sps_tmp_dir, change_wd = FALSE, project_name = "SPSProject")
sps_dir <- file.path(sps_tmp_dir, "SPSProject")
```
Here for building the vignette we are not switching to the app directory and are using a 
temp directory, in a real case, you **should not** store you SPS project in a **temp directory**.
Just use the following instead:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
spsInit()
```


By default, you will have a folder created under your current working directory, 
the name is `SPS_` + `today's date` in *ISO 8601* format, e.g. 
`r glue::glue("SPS_{format(Sys.time(), '%Y%m%d')}")`. It looks like this:

<pre>

</pre>


## Launch SPS 

By default, your working directory should be set inside that project folder automatically. 
If you are using Rstudio, *global.R* file will be opened for you. This is the only
file that you need to make custom change if there is any. 

In your *global.R*, scroll down to the bottom, you should see:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sps_app <- sps(
    vstabs = c("data_example", "plot_example1", "plot_example2"),
    plugin = "",
    server_expr = {
        msg("Custom expression runs -- Hello World", "GREETING", "green")
    }
)
```

This is the SPS main function. You can load/unload tabs by providing tab IDs in `vstabs` argument, like 
`c("tab1", "tab2)`. Open *config/tabs.csv* or use `spsTabInfo()` to see what tabs IDs can be load and other 
tab information. Currently you can only load/unload visualization tabs, the key word `vs` under column "*type*"; essential framework tabs(*core*) and workflow tabs (*wf*) are loaded automatically and these tabs cannot be modified.
The [developer section](#extend-sps) will teach you how to create your own tabs.

For this vignette example, we will use as it is, so now you can run the SPS by typing 
`shiny::runApp()` in console or click on the <img src=img/app_start.png style="display: inline; padding-left:0; width:10px; height:15px;">`Run App`
button on top right corner in Rstudio. The app should be launched. Click on the 
"Continue to app" button on the welcome screen and you should see SPS main dashboard like this one (Fig.2):

<center id="sps_ui">
![sps_ui](./img/sps_ui_main.jpg)
**Figure 2. SPS UI**
</center>

All SPS tabs are well classified into WF and VS part. We will start from WF management.

## WF management

WF management in SPS helps you to prepare a data analysis workflow files in [systemPipeR](https://systempipe.org/docs/systemPipeR/) (SPR) format. SPR is another 
R package that runs a WF in "command line + R code" manner. To run a SPR WF, you 
need to prepare three very important files: a metadata(targets) file that contains 
sample information, a workflow step file(Rmarkdown format) that defines the WF steps 
and a WF config file that helps the program to set up your directory. In SPS, one 
can easily prepare all of these three files in SPS tabs under "Workflow Management" 
section. You can find them at the left side navigation bar (Fig2 a-b). 

Under current version of SPS, we only help you to prepare and check format of these 
files. One should save these files and run a WF in SPR. Directly running a SPR WF 
in SPS will be supported in an upcomming release.

### Prepare a target file
Read ["Structure of targets file"](https://systempipe.org/docs/systemPipeR/#structure-of-targets-file) section in SPR vignette to better undertand the 
structure of this file. 

Now let us follow the order below to prepare a target file for a RNAseq project (Fig.3 A):

1. Choose "Targets" from navigation bar;
2. Select either "Example PE" or "Example SE"" for using a pair-end/single-end target file, then choose "confirm" on the pop-up. You will see the exmaple is loaded like Figure 3A. 
3. You can edit, right click to add/remove rows/columns (The first row is treated as column names);
4. SPR target file requres a header and you can edit it here. Headers should start with "#";
5. The left section can help you to check sample statistics and file existence. Choose any column you want from the dropdown to check and watch the statistics bar change in this section;
6. Click on "Add to task" can help you to check if your target file has any formatting problem. You should see a green success pop-up if everything is right;
7. Now your target file is ready and you can click "save" to download it and later use in a SPR project. 
8. Click on the "-" button on the "Workflow Progress", you should see the "Targets file" becomes green. 

<center>
![wf_targets](./img/sps_ui_targets.png)
**Figure 3. A. Workflow Management - Targets File**
</center>

### Prepare a workflow file

In SPR, workflows are defined in Rmarkdown files, you can read details and obtain them  [here](https://systempipe.org/pages/pipelines_area/).

Now let us follow the order below to see how SPS helps you to prepare a WF file for a RNAseq project (Fig.3 B):

1. Choose "Workflow File" from navigation bar;
2. Choose "Example Rmd" to load an RNAseq WF;
3. You can see the WF steps are displayed like a tree structure;
4. Check all steps in the WF that you want to include. You can skip (leave blank) some steps but it may cause the WF to fail. Read more SPR instructions before do so. 
5. Click on the "Plot steps" will show a flow chart of what the step execution orders will be when you run the WF in SPR. 
6. Click "Report preview" generates a preview of what the final report will look like for current RNAseq WF, but in the preview, no code is evaluated.
7. If you are satisfied with your WF file, click "Add to task" to update the workflow preparation progress just like it is for "targets file".
8. Now choose "Save New Rmd" to save this new WF file to later be used a SPR RNAseq project running. 

<center>
![wf_wf](./img/sps_ui_wf.png)
**Figure 3. B. Workflow Management - Workflow File**
</center>

### Prepare a configuration file

In SPR, the config file *SPRconfig.yaml* is required to define information like *project path*, *targets file path* and more. 
Normally, this file is generated automatically when one starts a SPR project, but if any modification is made, 
one needs to update this config file. For example, like we are now using SPS to prepare targets file and WF file and when we download these new files, file names and locations may be changed. In this case, we can update the config file in SPS (Fig.3 C):

1. Choose "Targets" from navigation bar;
2. Choose "Example" to load an RNAseq config file;
3. Edit the file content and follow *yaml* format. You may need to update the target file and WF file name and location in the "*targets*" and "*Rmd*" lines here. 
4. Once your editing is done, click "Add to task" to update the progress;
5. Now your new config file is ready and you can click "Save" to download it;
6. The progress tracker should all become green, which means you are ready to run the RNAseq workflow in SPR.

**Figure 3. C. Workflow Management - Config File**
</center>

###  Finish WF management

If you have followed this instruction so far, the three most important WF files 
have been created. You can copy them over to your SPR RNAseq project root and start to 
generate results. 

## Visualize workflow results

In the previous step that we have prepared files for running a SPR RNAseq workflow. 
Now assume that the workflow has been successfully run and we have obtained some results. In this 
part, we will use an example **count table** (RPKM normalized) to demonstrate 
how to use the VS components. 

VS tabs in SPS are sub-defined into two small groups, *data tabs* and *plot tabs*. A data tab 
is where you prepare, filter and preprocess data. A plot tab is where the actual plots are generated.
A plot tab requires at least one dataset from a data tab. Therefore, we need to first 
prepare data in a data tab, depending on the preprocess method we choose, we will be given 
different plot options (going to different plot tabs).

In this part, we will first load the raw count table and preprocess it in "Data Tab Example", generate some plots in "Plot Tab Example", and finally compare plots in the "Canvas" tab.

### Load raw count data

Follow instructions in Figure 4A:

1. Select "Data Tab Example" tab from the left;
2. Click "Start with this tab", it will be hidden after package requirement check has passed in the background. So it is not displayed in the figure. 
3. Let us load an example RPKM  read count table. If you upload your own table, 
the first column must be "Genes" and the rest of columns are treated as samples and they must be numeric values only. 
4. You can click on box below each column name to filter data. 
5. You can export your filtered data into clipboard, csv files, Excel ...
6. After the data filtration, we can start to preprocess data. Here are two methods you can choose from the left dropdown menu: "Do Nothing" does not change the filtered data, and "PCA" calculates PCs based on samples. Let us just try "Do Nothing";
7. When the data is preprocessed, plot options will be displayed in the below. You need to scroll down a little to see. "Do Nothing"  will give you the option 
for a bar plot. Click on the plot image will redirect you to the corresponding tab. 

<center>
![data_tab](./img/sps_ui_data_tab.png)
**Figure 4 A. VS - data tab**
</center>

### Create a plot

Follow instructions in Figure 4B:

1. Skip this step if you jumped directly from the "Data Tab Example", otherwise select "Plot Bar" to start;
2. Click "Start/Reload", this button will validate if you have the required data set. If yes, you will see plot options and other UI.
3. Click on "Render/Snapshot plot" to create the first plot. In SPS, the first time clicking on "Render" button creates a preview of the plot. From the second time and on, clicking on this button will take a *"snapshot"* of the plot. In SPS a snapshot is plot frozen with particular set of input data and plot options. It is isolated from the original plot tab and you cannot modify it anymore. It is similar to a screenshot but you can still interact within the plot. You will have a better understanding when we reach the *Canvas* section.
4. Now you can interact with plot. Try to hover your mouse and move around the plot. There are many interactive components on the plot. Read more of what you can interact with a [Plotly plot](plotly.com).
5. There is a tiny triangular icon on the right bottom corner of the plot where you can drag it to resize the plot to at most your window width and unlimited height;
6. A panel of plot selection tools including a screenshot button is on the top 
right;
7. Let us take a snapshot by clicking "Render". You should see a blue message pop up from the right bottom of your screen.
8. You can change the plot title by changing the text. This example plot tab only provides very simple plot controls. Change the text and watch how the plot title change. 
9. Change a title and click "Render" again to take a second snapshot.

<center>
![plot_tab](./img/sps_ui_plot_tab.png)
**Figure 4 B. VS - plot tab**
</center>

## Snap shots and Canvas

### Canvas

SPS Canvas is a place to display snapshots.  Snap shots can come from different
plot tabs, or the same plot tab with different plot options. Here you can combine 
plots together to a big scientific figure and compare plots with different plotting options side by side. 

If you have followed the instructions so far, you should have at least two snapshots and we can start to use Canvas.

1. Select "Canvas" tab;
2. You will see your snapshots in "Current snapshots" box. If you do not want to 
see any of them, drag it to the right side so it will not be rendered on Canvas.
3. Click "Refresh Canvas" to render the Canvas for a quick glimpse; 
4. You can change some Canvas settings on top;
5. In the "bar plot" section, we took two snapshots, one with original plot title and one with custom title. If you made the change, you can see it is reflected on 
Canvas. Move your mouse on the plots, you can see they are still interactive. Then, when you move the mouse near the top of a plot, a title section will show up and you can drag it to reposition your plot. 
6. Similar to a plot tab, you can resize any plot on Canvas by dragging the bottom right corner of a plot. 

<center>
![plot_tab](./img/sps_ui_canvas.png)
**Figure 5 A. Canvas**
</center>

Now go back to [Load raw count data](#load-raw-count-data) section and select 
"PCA" option in step 6 to reprocess and then go to PCA plot tab and repeat
instructions in [Create a plot](#create-a-plot) to create and snapshot a few PCA 
plots. The PCA plot tab has an additional plot point size control UI. You can try 
to take snapshots with different point size. Finally come back to canvas and render all snapshots. You should then be able to see how point size on plots are different in different snapshots. 
Now you can have a better understanding of the SPS snapshot-Cnavas feature.

### Snapshot management

Taking too many snapshots will slow down the app. A good solution is to manage 
them through the snapshot manage menu. You can access it by clicking the 
button "Snapshots" with a camera icon on the very top of SPS dashboard banner. 
It will open up a big menu screen (Fig. 5B). 

1. The left side displays all current snapshots. The label means the plot tab ID of which plot tab it comes from and the number after the dash means it is the Nth snapshot coming from that particular plot tab;
2. If you want to delete any snapshot, drag it to the right;
3. Click on "DESTROY" will permanently delete selected snapshots and cannot be recovered.
4. Download your current snapshots to a compressed file.
5. You can upload saved snapshot file and continue to work on it later. 

Due to internet security reasons, snapshot files are encrypted. Each SPS project 
has an unique key pair. Therefore, it is not possible to run a snapshot file in 
a different SPS project.

# Advanced features


## SPS plugins

We have created many more plots options and 
they are distributed as "SPS plugins". A SPS plugin is a collection of SPS tabs that 
become small R packages. 
You need to install the plugin like you do with normal R packages by `install.packages`, 
`BiocManager::install` or `remotes::install_github()`. The plugins(packages) come with 
SPS tabs, data, and other helper functions. Using `spsAddPlugin()` function, you 
are able to load them into SPS framework. 

Using `spsAddPlugin()` without any argument will list all available plugins and 
instructions to install them. 

```{r , eval=TRUE}
spsAddPlugin()
```

To load a specific plugin:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
spsAddPlugin(plugin = "PLUGIN_NAME", app_path = "PATH_OF_SPS")
```

At this stage, there is only one plugin, the *spsBio*: plots for biological data 
visualization. It is **under testing and please expect unstableness**. Under your project 
directory:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("systemPipeR/spsBio")
spsAddPlugin(plugin = "spsBio")
```

Inside your SPS project root, in the *global.R* file, specify that you want to 
load the plugin to app and start the app like normal:
```{r}
sps_app <- sps(
    vstabs = c("data_example", "plot_example1", "plot_example2"),
    plugin = "spsBio",
    server_expr = {
        msg("Custom expression runs -- Hello World", "GREETING", "green")
    }
)
```

## Configuration

### App options

App options in SPS are controlled by "SPS options". These options can change 
app appearance, debugging level, server server behaviors, *etc*. The valid options can 
be found and change on the `global.R` file. They are similar to *Shiny* options, 
but unlike *shiny* options are single values, SPS options are passed using the `Option(sps = list(...))` 
function in `global.R` as a group. To view all options and their default, valid
values('*' means any value is okay):

```{r , eval=TRUE}
viewSpsDefaults(app_path = sps_dir)
```

To view a single option value, use `spsOption(opt = "OPTION_NAME")`; to overwrite a single 
option, use `spsOption(opt = "OPTION_NAME", value = "NEW_VALUE")`.

<p style="color:var(--info)">Note: Do not worry if you set some invalid values, on app start, `sps()` will check all SPS
options, ignore unknown values and set invalid values back to default. You will see warning 
messages on console to tell you specifically what is wrong with your options.</p>

| Option          | Description                       | Default | Other     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| mode            | running mode                      | "local" | "server"  |
| warning_toast   | show security warnings?           | TRUE    | FALSE     |
| loading_screen  | show loading screen?              | TRUE    | FALSE     |
| loading_theme   | loading screen theme              | "vhelix"| any string|
| use_crayon      | colorful console message?         | TRUE    | FALSE     |
| verbose         |more details for SPS functions?    | TRUE    | FALSE     |
| admin_url       |admin_page query url               | "admin" | any string|

some details:

- mode: this option will change how the upload files are selected.
    - local: You can choose file from server side, and it is a direct link, no file will be copied to server. Most often used when you are on you own computer. <span style="color:var(--info)">It is still choosing files from the server side, because you are using your own computer as a Shiny server.</span>
    - server: Choose files from the client side, and upload as a temp file to the server.
    - If you are on you own computer, there is no difference, but `local` mode can avoid copy your files to temp. <span style="color:var(--info)">If you are deploying the app to cloud, please **use server mode**</span>
- warning_toast: A toast pop-up message when you are under some dangerous options when app starts.
- loading_theme: `loading_screen` must be `TRUE`. Only one theme for now, we will add more in future.
- verbose: Give you more information on debugging.
- admin_url: the admin page url , will be added in an upcoming version, a preview can be seen by adding "/?admin" to the end of app url, e.g. "[https://tgirke.shinyapps.io/systemPipeShiny/?admin](https://tgirke.shinyapps.io/systemPipeShiny/?admin)".

### Tab configurations

Tabs are registered(defined) by the *tabs.csv* file under SPS project *config* folder. It contains information for all 
the tabs. Do not modify it if you don't plan to build new tabs. See [developer section](#extend-spsfor-developers) for how 
to operate this file. 

To control what tabs to appear(load/unload) on SPS, pass the tab IDs of tabs you want to see to 
`vstabs =` argument on `sps()`

```{r , eval=FALSE}
sps_app <- sps(vstabs = c("ID1", "ID2", ...))
```

*tabs.csv* has all the tab IDs. Under current version of SPS, you can only load/unload 
tabs in the "vs" type. Tabs under "core" and "wf" types are unable to change.

## A variety of additional shiny widgets 

There are many useful HTML components that 
can be use outside out SPS. You can include these widgets in your own Shiny apps without 
loading SPS main framework. 

# Extend SPS

As a framework, SPS allows users to add/remove/customize individual tabs. At current 
version, you can only modify tabs in VS part(data tabs, plot tabs). 
Use `newTabData` to add a new data tab and `newTabPlot` for a plot tab. These functions 
will help you to **create the tab file**, store it to the *R* folder in your SPS project, and
**register tab information** by adding records to *config/tabs.csv*.
Most arguments are self-explanatory or can be 
easily understood by reading the the help file. 

# How to deploy the application

There is a *deploy.R* file in the SPS project root and you can use it to deploy the 
app to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). You can use this file to set up 
your account and deploy the app. SPS is a deploy-ready framework. If you set up your 
account correctly, you can deploy it as soon as the project is created. It 
is recommended to create -> test/run -> deploy a Shiny app from Rstudio and follows 
[this instruction](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html).
